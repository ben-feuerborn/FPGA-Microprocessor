# FPGA-Microprocessor
## Overview
This project involved designing and implementing a custom microprocessor from the ground up using Vivado VHDL. The processor is capable of executing MIPS assembly programs, with a focus on efficient frame compression analysis. The development process followed Agile methodologies, incorporating iterative design improvements and structured testing.


## Features
* **Custom 32-bit Microprocessor:** Designed and implemented in VHDL.
* **MIPS Assembly Execution:** Supports basic instruction set functionality.
* **Frame Compression Simulation:** Analyzes frame sequences to find the closest numerical match.
* **Pipeline Processing:** Optimized execution through modular design.
* **Agile Workflow:** Weekly sprint reviews, retrospectives, and iterative refinements.


## Technologies Used
* **Vivado VHDL** for hardware description and simulation.
* **MIPS Assembly** for instruction set implementation.
* **Git** and **GitHub** for version control and collaborative development.


## Development Process
1) **Architecture Design:** Defined CPU components including ALU, registers, control unit, and memory.
2) **Implementation:** Developed modular components, ensuring compatibility and scalability.
3) **Testing & Debugging:** Verified functionality through simulation and hardware deployment.
4) **Iteration:** Refined based on performance evaluations and Agile sprint feedback.


## Original Course Description
Computer architecture is the science and art of selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create a computer that meets functional, performance and cost goals. This course qualitatively and quantitatively examines computer design trade-offs, teaches the fundamentals of computer architecture and organization, including CPU, memory, registers, arithmetic unit, control unit, and input/output components. Topics include reduced instruction set computer architectures (RISC), using the MIPS central processor as an example, interface between assembly and high level programming constructs and hardware, instruction and memory cache systems, performance evaluation, benchmarks, and use of the SPIM/Verilog Simulators for the MIPS architecture. ECE369 serves students two ways. For those who will continue in computer architecture, it lays foundation of state-of-the-art techniques implemented in current and future high- performance computing platforms. For those students not continuing in computer architecture, it gives an overview of the kind of techniques used in today's microprocessors.
